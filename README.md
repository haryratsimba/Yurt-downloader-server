## Credits

* [Yurt](https://thenounproject.com/term/yurt/457098/) and [Play](https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=play&i=938627) icons used in the empty / filled download list are respectively designed by Denis Sazhin and Shastry from the Noun Project
* Conversion is done using the [Youtube to MP3 API](https://www.yt-download.org)

## Limitations

* As the conversion is based on a third party API, the download speed may vary according to the API server availability
* In case of network errors, try a lower audio ratio (eg : 128kbps)
